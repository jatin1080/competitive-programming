Some notes useful in competitive programming.
Stacks can go very much hand in hand with trees.
A tree with n nodes has n-1 edges.
Balanced trees are used in heaps and maps. Red black tree is an example of balanced BST.
A full binary tree that has n leaves has n-1 internal nodes.
Graphs -> Trees -> Binary Trees

Binary Trees:
    In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

Time Complexity:
    Some facts:
        n < nlog(n)
        n^x < n^y if x < y
        n^x < c^n where c is a constant (polynomials will eventually grow slower than exponentials)
        log(n) < n
        c^n < n! < n^n where c is a constant
        1<logn<sqrt(n)<n<nlogn<n^2<n^3<…<2^n<3^n<…<n^n
